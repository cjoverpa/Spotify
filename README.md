# üéß Spotify Beats: Live Now

This web-based music player dynamically displays the **currently playing song or episode** from your Spotify account. It fetches real-time data from [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-the-users-currently-playing-track?additional_types=episode) and shows details like the song title, artist, and album art. Front-end of this project is also available at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/minhashemi/pen/BagMjJz).

## Why Middleware is Essential üîí

You might wonder, "Do we need middleware to display Spotify‚Äôs currently playing track?" The short answer: **Yes!** 

Real-world APIs, like Spotify's, require proper authentication. You can't safely include credentials like client IDs, secrets, or tokens directly in your front-end JavaScript because doing so would expose them, compromising your app's security. Instead, we use a secure middleware to handle communication with Spotify‚Äôs API, keeping sensitive information safe.

### üéØ Solution:
Set up middleware to handle API requests. Instead of calling Spotify‚Äôs API directly (e.g., `https://api.spotify.com/user/username/get-now-playing`), your app will securely call an endpoint like `https://mymiddleware.com/get-now-playing` to fetch data in JSON format.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Defines the structure and layout of the music player.
- **CSS**: Provides styling, animations, and ensures responsive design across different devices.
- **JavaScript**: Handles dynamic updates, fetching data, and interacting with the backend.
- **Cloudflare Workers**: A serverless backend for securely handling API requests, including the Spotify API calls.
- **Spotify Web API**: Used to retrieve real-time information about the currently playing track or episode.

## üìù To-Do List: Future Updates

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm planning to add or improve in future versions of this project:

- [ ] Add a button to redirect the user to the current playing item for direct listening.
- [ ] Improve the design with more appealing CSS animations and transitions.
- [ ] Ensure the player is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
- [ ] Keep a log of recently played tracks or episodes.
- [ ] Add auto-refresh functionality to update the track every few seconds without a manual refresh.
- [ ] Track name must only scroll when it's longer than card width

## Setting Up the Back-end üõ†

Cloudflare Workers offer a serverless platform to run code snippets globally. Cloudflare provides **100,000 free requests per day**, making it perfect for this project.

### Steps to Set Up Cloudflare Worker:

1. **Sign up for Cloudflare**: [Register here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers).
2. **Create a Worker**: Navigate to the Cloudflare Workers dashboard after logging in.

5. **Test the Worker**: Open the terminal in the right pane of the Cloudflare dashboard and enter:
   ```url
   https://spotify.[username].workers.dev/test
   ```
   
   If you see "Middleware setup successful!", you're good to go! If not, repeat the setup.

6. **Deploy the Worker**: Click "Save and Deploy".

## Setting Up the GitHub Repository üìÇ

### Steps to Set Up the Front-End:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Go to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/minhashemi/Spotify) and fork it.
   
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Spotify-Widget
   ```

3. **Modify JavaScript Files**: Open `front-end/script.js` and replace the following lines:
   ```javascript
   var serviceHost = "https://spotify.minhashemi.workers.dev";
   var spotifyUser = "Amin";
   ```
   **Update** `serviceHost` with your Cloudflare Worker URL and `spotifyUser` with your Spotify username.

4. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated service host and user details"
   git push
   ```
